<p class="p1">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In 1848, major change was taking place in Denmark. About six months before Hans and Ane were married, the king of their country, Frederik VII declared that he "renounced his absolute right," making way for a constitutional monarchy. As mentioned before, Denmark declared war against Prussia in that year as well. During the following year, an assembly of people drafted a constitution for the country, which was ratified and put into effect. King Frederik VII signed the constitution on June 5, 1849. Among the provisions of the constitution was the guarantee of freedom of religion. <a href="#note-27dcf280"><sup>1</sup></a> In the fall LDS conference of 1849 (Oct. 6,7) in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, Brigham Young called missionaries to go to several European countries, including Denmark. <a href="#note-27dd1990"><sup>2</sup></a> Two missionaries arrived in Copenhagen the following year. One of those missionaries carried with him his work of translating the Book of Mormon in the Danish language: "Elder Peter O. Hansen had translated most of the Book of Mormon into Danish before leaving America, and soon after the Elders had arrived in Copenhagen, steps were taken to have his translation revised and printed in that language." <a href="#note-27dd52b0"><sup>3</sup></a> This was the first translation of the Book of Mormon after the English version. (The Danish translation was published in 1851. Peter O. Hansen did much of the translation while working on the Nauvoo temple. <a href="#note-27dd7e10"><sup>4</sup></a> )</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">There are a few interesting facts about the beginning of missionary work in Denmark. First, even though there was now a Danish constitution in place guaranteeing freedom of religion, the people did not really understand it and many of the authorities were not inclined to honor that right. Society moves slowly in making such fundamental change. Second, because of previous conditions of the state-controlled religion (Lutheranism), priests had the exclusive right to distribute the Bible in Danish. <a href="#note-27ddaf80"><sup>5</sup></a> Therefore, as missionaries began to preach, they found that they had to first teach the Bible to the people, since they did not have bibles in their homes. The Book of Mormon, as previously mentioned, was translated and available and taught as well. Also, the missionaries were very busy in printing other materials that were used in teaching the restored Gospel. A third fact of significance was that the overwhelming majority of those serving as missionaries in Denmark were local people who had recently joined the church themselves. <a href="#note-27dde850"><sup>6</sup></a> Therefore, missionary work was certainly a challenge.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">As mentioned, a number of tracts and publications were printed in the Danish language. Upon arriving, and before the Danish Book of Mormon was printed, Elder Hansen published a four-page tract in the Danish language, entitled "En Advarsel til Folket" (Danish, for "A Warning to the People"). This was the first Latter-day Saint literature ever printed in Scandinavia." <a href="#note-27de1330"><sup>7</sup></a> Also of considerable significance was the translation and publishing of Parley P. Pratt's very successful missionary document, "Voice of Warning." Andrew Jenson records: "In 1855, a translation of Parley P. Pratt's 'Voice of Warning' was published in Copenhagen, Denmark, entitled 'En Advarsels Rost.' " <a href="#note-27de31b0"><sup>8</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The work of the missionaries spread rapidly after the start in 1850, despite opposition from clergy and authorities. In 1850, there were 139 Danish people baptized into the church. By the end of 1853, the total local membership was 1,703 [not including 602 who had emigrated to Deseret (Utah Territory) and about 100 who were excommunicated]. <a href="#note-27deb5b0"><sup>9</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The local people were not very friendly to the new converts. There were mobs who attacked the members and missionaries. Baptisms were often performed at night or in secret, to avoid attracting attention. <a href="#note-27dedfe0"><sup>10</sup></a> There was even a young man who had joined the church who was stabbed to death shortly afterward. <a href="#note-27defc70"><sup>11</sup></a> This was one condition that encouraged recent converts to emigrate. At the time, members were strongly encouraged in their church sermons to emigrate to America to Zion. The missionary effort continued and an average of about 1000 were baptized into the church each year from 1853 to 1857, the year when Hans and his family were introduced to the Gospel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Jørgen, Hans' brother, and his family were the first among Hans and Ane's relatives to embrace this new religion. Jørgen's second daughter, Christiane, was baptized on 6 Mar 1857, at age 14. Hans and his family were close at hand: "He and his family heard the Gospel for the first time in the winter of 1857. The gospel had just been brought to Denmark, and at Christmas time, 1857, they accepted it. On Feb. 5, 1858, Hans and Ane were baptized in Torpegavn. <a href="#note-27df1900"><sup>12</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The ice was broken with an ax in order that they could be baptized." <a href="#note-27df3420"><sup>13</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hans was confirmed on February 14, 1858, and Ane two days later on the 16th. Another interesting fact is that Ane gave birth to Caroline Sophia a little more than two months following, on April 30, 1858, in Torpegavn. She was "with child" at the time of her baptism. This choice for baptism, made by Hans and Ane, was undoubtedly the most significant event of their lives, with the most lasting consequences.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Also among their relatives, Ane's brother, Jacob Nielsen, and his wife, Ellen, were baptized a few months later, on June 14, 1858. He and his family lived in Solbjerg, a small village near Ørslev. They continued to live there until they emigrated to America in 1868. They had 8 children, only 2 surviving to adulthood. <a href="#note-27df66c0"><sup>14</sup></a> Two of the children, baby Annie and 11 year-old Karen died in the process of their emigration to Zion. <a href="#note-27df81c0"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">1858 proved to be an interesting time for the church in Denmark. All American missionaries were pulled out of Denmark and called home to Utah. This was because of a crisis in Utah. The U. S. government received false reports from advisors and subsequently sent an army, known as Johnston's Army <a href="#note-27dfbb40"><sup>16</sup></a>. Because of the anticipated effects of the approaching army, most missionaries were called home. Emigration dropped considerably as a result, especially in 1858, to about 12% of the previous year's baptisms (see the chart in an earlier footnote).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Meanwhile, Hans and Jørgen and their families were living in the same town, Gierslev, when the 1860 census was taken. <a href="#note-28401640"><sup>17</sup></a> Members of the LDS church were subject to criticism, prejudice and even harm because of their new affiliation. It was common for members to live near each other for moral and physical support. Hans and his family moved many times in his life so far, and it is likely that he now lived in the same town as his brother for that reason. The 1860 Census lists Hans and his wife, Ane as "Mormon", but the children are still listed as "Luth" or Lutheran. Hans is listed as a day laborer, not as a weaver any more. He is not listed as a stone-cutter, either, which was his trade for the remainder of his life. According to a family history, because of his new affiliation with the LDS church he was no longer allowed any work in his trade as a weaver. <a href="#note-284033a0"><sup>18</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their son, Andrew William wrote: "My father was a weaver by trade and he was very poor and when he obeyed the Gospel, the people where he lived got angry at him and would not support him with their work, so he was forced to leave that place." <a href="#note-28406c90"><sup>19</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stone-cutting would become his way of life after this. Jørgen is listed in the 1860 census as an unskilled laborer and his whole family as Mormons. <a href="#note-28409680"><sup>20</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Christiane is not listed with the family. She was 17 at the time and may have been working outside the home to provide for the family. She did not get married until 1867 and emigrated to America years later than others of her family.</p>

<p class="p5">"Under mild pressure from public opinion in Copenhagen, King Frederick VII proclaimed, in March 1848, that he had renounced his absolute right and considered himself a constitutional monarch. He stated that in the future his ministers would have the responsibility of the government. This significant revolution in Denmark was characterized by calm and dignity. …</p>
<p class="p5">"A short time after this revolution a Constituent Assembly, which also included a number of members selected by the King, was chosen by general election. A new Constitution was drafted and presented to this Assembly where a vote in favor carried by a large majority. On the fifth of June, 1849, Frederik VII signed the new Constitution.</p>
<p class="p5">"This Constitution, known as the June Constitution, has continued in effect to the present time. It introduced some of the most far reaching concepts which the Danish society has ever known. It was, among other things, a guarantee for 'private and civic freedom, freedom of religion, freedom of assemble, freedom of the press and the inviolability of house and property.'"</p>

<p class="p5">"A provision had long ago given the priests of Denmark exclusive right to distribute the Bible in Danish. Elder Snow found a few honorable exceptions among the clergy, who favored religious freedom and the diffusion of scriptures, but "we sometimes may hunt whole neighborhoods over and not find a copy of the scriptures, except perhaps, in church, or with the priest."

<p class="p5">"For the first ten years of the Danish Mission, the local brethren did not merely dominate the scene, they were the scene. Some of them served five years before emigrating to America. During the first decade, Utah sent only 13 missionaries to Scandinavia, and six of these were Scandinavians who had joined the church in America. The early period saw very few American elders serving in Denmark." (p 77)</p>
