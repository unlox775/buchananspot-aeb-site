<p class="p1">Author's Note</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p5">I grew up in a home that valued the sense of ancestry. Both parents were very involved in genealogical research and family records, and yet, up until this year, I knew very little about my ancestor, Hans Sorensen. This document and the accompanying research began early this year with an exploration of Danish records that were generously provided by the Danish State Archives as an online service. This one resource was fundamental in the start of my adventure that has taken up many hours of my life this year.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">As I progressed, I was driven by a strong personal desire and inspired, I believe, by the spirit of my ancestors and by a loving Heavenly Father, to bring this history to my family and to the many descendants of Hans Sorensen and his wives. Foremost, I thank my immediate family for their patience in letting me spend so much time working on my computer and visiting the LDS Family History Library and collaborating with newly found relatives.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">One blessing I discovered in this process, besides getting to know Hans Sorensen, was the joy of discovering cousins and relatives along the way. The process of discovery led me to find many fine, generous and good people who also cherish the legacy of righteous ancestors. Among these, I most appreciate Thelma Pollei, a grand-daughter of Hans Sorensen and Matilda. She gave me many documents and pictures that were unknown to my side of the Sorensen family. I feel that this one acquaintance has been most providential in bringing many stories of Hans Sorensen together. Another valued resource is the autobiography of Andrew William Sorensen, published by Marilyn Fleming. There are others who have helped in this work as well, too many to mention by name.</p>
