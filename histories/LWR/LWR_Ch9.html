<p class="p1">Chapter 9</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">It seems that when Lorenzo and his families are getting settled in and running a "routine" life, there is not much reported in the various news items or journal entries of others. That makes sense because normal, uneventful life rarely brings one to the attention of others. It was the same way in Centerville before the call came for Lorenzo to the Indian Mission in 1853 and again for him to take his families to the Kanab area in 1865. In each of those cases, there were several years just prior to those calls that little information is available concerning their lives and living. The past few years are the same here. Kanarra was established and life was moving smoothly, or so we suppose, because of the lack of news to the contrary.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">In the beginning of 1873, Lorenzo was called upon to lead an expedition to go into Arizona to explore the area and find places suitable for settlement. As is the case with most of these kinds of expeditions, it took place in the winter. It is probable that Brigham Young called upon men to accomplish these tasks in the winter because it would not take them away from their farms during the important times of the year. Unfortunately, winter is a difficult time to explore uncivilized regions. Lorenzo was obedient and led a successful expedition.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Jacob Hamblin was also called to be a leader of this expedition. According to his biography, Jacob received a letter at about Christmas time, 1872, detailing his assignment. He told his family "We're to leave Toquerville January 22 … " Jacob with his mount and several pack animals arrived at Toquerville the day before the designated time to leave. That evening he learned that Lorenzo Roundy was to be the President of the company and himself to be in charge of Indian affairs." <a href="#note-1c93f6b0"><sup>1</sup></a> Lorenzo received his letter, dated January 7, 1873, which was addressed to him and to Bishop John R. Murdock. <a href="#note-1c34c740"><sup>2</sup></a> According to the Hamblin history, as the group met in Toquerville, Lorenzo explained the purpose of the expedition: "They were to go to the East of the San Francisco Mountains, in Arizona, until they intersected the head-waters of the Rio Verde, then travel down that river until they were satisfied as to the character of the country, the nature of the soil, prospects for irrigation, timber, stock range, etc. … They were to show a peaceable, considerate spirit to the Indians residing in the country to be explored; to kill no game except such as might be actually needed for food. … Also, they were all reminded to keep a journal of each day's doings." <a href="#note-1c911e70"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Lorenzo sent a detailed letter to Brigham Young summarizing the results of the expedition (the entire letter is in the footnote). <a href="#note-1c91a9a0"><sup>4</sup></a> Lorenzo does not specify any dates of his journey, but from the diary of John D. Lee we have a fairly good start and end date. The company arrived in Lonely Dell, which is where Lee's Ferry is located, on February 1, 1873. Lee says that the company consisted of 12 men, 15 horses and three baggage wagons. It took them two days to make the crossing. <a href="#note-1c58cb80"><sup>5</sup></a> Lee then records the company coming back on the 25th of February, saying "This morning Capt. Roundy &amp; Men &amp; 26 animals recrossed the Colerado River from a Tour of 25 days in region of the Sanfrancisco Mountains." <a href="#note-1c58ef60"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The expedition travelled from Kanab to Buckskin Mountain to House Rock and on to Jacob Pools and to Lee's Ferry. In his letter, Lorenzo describes the water conditions often as drinkable, but somewhat bitter. They seemed to be able to find vegetation as necessary for their animals. at times they waded through deep snow. From Lee's Ferry they continued on to Navajo Springs and Bitter Springs on to Moencopi (spelled many different ways throughout the writings). The went along the Little Colorado River and on to the San Francisco Mountains. They came out to near Prescott, Arizona and then turned to go back home. His report was not very encouraging.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">An interesting commentary on this expedition is recorded twenty years later in the Juvenile Instructor. It shows the complete faith Lorenzo had in the church leaders, particularly Brigham Young. Parts of that article and included here:</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">"Prophecy Fulfilled" by "Guillermo"</p>
<p class="p3">"While in the company the other evening of one of the brethren, who was one of Bishop Roundy's party when they explored the Little Colorado country in the northern part of Arizona, in 1873, … he related two striking occurrences of the literal fulfillment of the promises made in the name of our Savior … by Brigham Young … .</p>
<p class="p3">"He said in substance: 'When we were set apart by Brigham Young for that mission he promised us, among other things, that if we would do as we were told we would not fail any night to have grass for our horses; and also that as we were going down into a game country, he would promise use, if we would not kill any more game that we needed for our own use, we would always have meat when we needed it.</p>
<p class="p3">In regard to the first-mentioned promise, one of the brethren who was in the party said that if President Young knew so much about the country we were going into as he did, he certainly would not make them any such promise, for he had been down into parts of it and found much country destitute of grass. On our way down we found grass every night as had been promised. … But one day there was more snow … about three feet deep … obliged to make one horse wallow through a short distance to break the track … . We kept on all day this way, and about sundown one of the brethren spoke up and said, 'Bishop Roundy, what about President Young's promise now?'</p>
<p class="p3">"He was assured that we certainly would find some yet, and we travelled on. Just before dark we crossed over a small ridge, and on the other side we found a spot about one hundred yards wide by three hundred yards long, without any snow, and covered with as pretty green grass as I ever saw. …"</p>
<p class="p3">" … on the way back … being stopped by the very deep snow, we were compelled to retrace our steps and go around by way of Kanab … made us about four days longer than we expected, our store of provisions ran short. … I said to my companion, 'Well, what about that meat? Isn't it about time we were getting it, we need it now?'</p>
<p class="p3">"… about half an hour afterwards I espied … a large, white mountain hare …</p>
<p class="p3">"In conclusion the brother said that Bishop Roundy was a man with as much faith in the gospel and the promises of the servants of God as any man he ever saw … ." <a href="#note-1c913aa0"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Other printed reports of this expedition appeared in various forms, including records of reports given in the Southern Utah Conference. <a href="#note-1c332c70"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">A few months later, there was a concern at the ferry. Some settlers, sent to Arizona by Brigham young, became discouraged by the dry conditions and a fear of the Indians. Some returned from the Arizona Mission area to the ferry and asked Lee what his advice was. He records, "I advised them to put their animals on the best feed &amp; take care of them till an answer can be had from Prest. Young and another Boat built (the main ferry boat was destroyed in a freak wind accident a few days before); that I did not think the Mission was broke up. I expect Bro. Roundy &amp; some others will be here soon. Be patient, for all will work togeather for good." <a href="#note-1c336090"><sup>9</sup></a> Lorenzo arrived on the 23rd bringing some animals and people to help the settlers. Lorenzo had received a telegram from President Young saying that "he would like to have him take a few Brethren &amp; go over to AraZona &amp; See whether the water had realy dried up, or whether it was the feeling of the Brethrn that had dreid up &amp; report immediately." <a href="#note-1c05cd70"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Lorenzo continued to be very involved in general affairs in the region. The Deseret News reported in a list of "Presiding Elders and Bishops" of the LDS church "in Utah Territory and adjacent Settlements" and included L. W. Roundy as the presiding authority in Kane County, Kanarra. <a href="#note-1c05fde0"><sup>11</sup></a> Over the years, Kanarra gets reported as being in Kane, Iron and Washington counties. The boundaries changed a little over the years and Kanarra was near the borders of all three. Apparently, he was also somewhat involved with the industries and activities of Washington County. In a history of the cotton industry of the area, there is a reference in March 1873 to a letter sent to Lorenzo by Secretary A. R. Whitehead reporting on the condition of the cotton factory, stating "The Factory is doing well with one exception … we have no dyer, and it bothers us considerable." <a href="#note-1c060ac0"><sup>12</sup></a>Apparently, they had a dyer to work in the factory, but he gave his notice and quit. It is unclear how Lorenzo was involved in this, but it shows the considerable influence he had in the affairs of the region.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">It is possible that Lorenzo's interest in the cotton mills was a business interest though that is not established anywhere. From writings of his family, we know that he was involved in business. His daughter, Annie Isadore, write in her history several references to his work. "My father and William Ford owned a grist mill by the foot of the hill part of town. … The summer after my father died, I went with my mother and brother down to Dixie. It was up on the Virgin River. Father had an orchard there. We went to dry fruit. … Father owned shares in a co-op sheep herd, cattle herd and a store. He used to bring me candy, but candy was very scarce then as they had to have their freight from Salt Lake City by team. It would take them about three weeks to make the trip." <a href="#note-1a804db0"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Also in the spring of that year, it was noted by John Johnson Davies that the United Order was established in Kanarra under the direction of Bishop Lorenzo Roundy. He stated that the order did not last very long. Davies says that the failure was not because it was not right. <a href="#note-1ae6a210"><sup>14</sup></a> The Deseret News has a report in 1874 stating that the United Order was established in Kanarra, among other places. <a href="#note-1b599780"><sup>15</sup></a> This report, though dated 1874, does not specify when the community first established the Order, so the reports may not be conflicting as to the date.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Later in the spring, it was again reported that the area conference was held in Saint George, and that Bishop Roundy delivered a "very interesting" discourse. <a href="#note-1b59c660"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">It appears that Lorenzo continued to be involved more and more in the Arizona explorations and settlement effort. There is an account in the newspaper later in the summer about Lorenzo going to Lee's Ferry and making a report. <a href="#note-1a8b2c80"><sup>17</sup></a><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">An interesting artifact can be found attesting to Lorenzo's presence in Arizona. House Rock is in a valley about 30 miles west and south of Lee's Ferry and is on the trail that runs from the Utah settlements to the Colorado River at Lee's Ferry. There is a place where Lorenzo's name is carved in the rock. Within a few feet John D. Lee's name is also carved. (This photo is courtesy of Bob Ford.)</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><img src="LWR_Ch9-images/LWRoundyCarved.jpg" alt="LWR carved initials"></span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This was an interesting year for Lorenzo. One wonders what memories were brought to mind to him because it is in December on 1873 that he makes his official statement about the conspiracy affair against Joseph Smith many years before. Brigham Young, on his way to Saint George, was in Kanarra on Saturday, December 13th, 1873. The report states that "While in Kanarra on this day, Bishop Lorenzo W. Roundy made the following statement to President Brigham Young in the presence of Elders George A. Smith, A Milton Musser and Robert C. Lund, which was reported and filed in the Historian's Office" [See chapter 3, footnote 3.]</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">About a month after this, Lorenzo was in Salt Lake City as a member of the Territorial Legislature. There are several references in the Deseret News mentioning his work in the legislature. He was appointed to the "Roads, Bridges, Ferries and Canyons" committee and the "Indian Affairs" committee. <a href="#note-1c315e90"><sup>18</sup></a> In his work, he represented the people in various bills and petitions, including the incorporation of Toquer <a href="#note-1a8af0b0"><sup>19</sup></a> as a city as well as Washington City, <a href="#note-1a8c4900"><sup>20</sup></a> seeking appropriations for two roads <a href="#note-1c355690"><sup>21</sup></a> and money for "free schools throughout the Territory." <a href="#note-1c050c80"><sup>22</sup></a> He also recommended a judge and two Notary Publics, <a href="#note-1d3a2c40"><sup>23</sup></a> who were then elected. One of the roads proposed for funding, between Harrisburg and Bellevue, was finally approved. <a href="#note-1d39bdf0"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="p3">A brief mention of Lorenzo is made in John D. Lee's diary for April, 7, 1874. William Berry, a son-in-law of Lee's lived in Kanarra and Lee visited the community at times. He reported a meeting there, saying that President Brigham Young and George A. Smith were "put up at Bp. Roundy's &amp; I at Wm. Berrie's." Some meetings were held which were reported to contain valuable instruction. he also mentioned that the "Entore setlement (except 2) went into the new order with Bishop Roundy, Prest., &amp; Wm. Berry, vice Prest." <a href="#note-1d3a1730"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Again in the fall of 1874, Brigham Young came south, stopping by Kanarra where they had dinner with the Roundy family. The report says that "At all meetings they begged the saints to be faithful and diligent in the discharge of their duties. They also preached the doctrine of Baptism for the dead, and urged the necessity of the brethren building the Temple and upon the benefits of the United Order, if carried out according to the designs of the Lord, the importance of day and Sabbath schools, etc." <a href="#note-1c93bcc0"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Conditions are quiet again for a year or so. We know that Lorenzo organized the Relief Society in Kanarra on December 14, 1875, sustaining his wife, Susannah as the president.<a href="#note-1ae69080"><sup>27</sup></a> Other than that, there is not anything significantly reported concerning Lorenzo until the first part of January 1876 when he once again serves in the Utah Territorial legislature. He is again appointed to serve on the Roads, Bridges, Ferries and Canyons committee and the Indian Affairs committee. <a href="#note-1b7490c0"><sup>28</sup></a> He presents a much larger appropriations petition for the schools, this time representing 150 people, asking for $30,000 annually. <a href="#note-1c04d5f0"><sup>29</sup></a> He also asks for some money for building and improving roads, including a road through the area from Kanab to Lee's Ferry. <a href="#note-1c074af0"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Lorenzo sent a telegram to President Young in March. Apparently, President Young was planning to come south and go over the divide between the upper Sevier and the upper Kanab and Lorenzo advised against it because of the snow and mud. He also reported the state of the cooperative as far as the survival of the stock through a hard winter. <a href="#note-1d393cc0"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="p3">The next recorded information concerning Lorenzo mentions his assignment to go with some others to "visit our settlements in Arizona." This would be Lorenzo's last such assignment. <a href="#note-1d391460"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p class="p3">"… Bishop L. W. Roundy related some items connected with his exploring expedition beyond the Colorado river. After crossing the Colorado he traveled to Mo-in-koppy, about 50 miles. Seven miles beyond the Colorado is the Navajo Spring. From there it was nine or ten miles to Bitter Spring. From the latter point it was ten miles to some holes in the rocks, containing water, Feed was good in that region. Traveled down a valley a quarter of a mile wide, went through cedars about three miles form there being the first timber after leaving Buckskin mountains. Mo-in-koppy was a place a good deal like St. George Valley, many springs breaking out under the hills. Land limited, partly impregnated with salts. Where we first struck the little Colorado river, scattering cottonwood trees were found; bottoms a quarter of a mile wide, wider higher up, timber also better. Proceeded up the river, camped near some falls, bottoms two to three miles wide, with considerable timber. Beyond the San Francisco mountains. Went in sight of the Oriba village of the Moquis Indians. The Moquis family lived on the river, but had been obliged to take to the hills for protection on account of the Navajos and Apaches. Came across the Butterfield mail road and also to where the R. R. was staked off. Their guide told them that on the Little Colorado the climate was always mild, snow fell but little and thawed immediately. Described a snow storm, which they encountered in the Pines at the San Francisco Mountains. South of the San Francisco Mountains the country was very broken. Came across a very wild timbered country near the San Francisco Mountain, saw some turkeys, but failed to see the walnut and hickory timber supposed to be there, nor any water, not land fit for settlements. Thought that on the Little Colorado the climate was warm and favorable and the facilities for settling were very good. Cottonwood timber abundant, land rich, grass and water plenty. The Little Colorado was not quite the size of the Virgen River, water a little brackish, but better than that from the former river. The distance from the Little Colorado to good saw timber on the San Francisco Mountain was from fifteen to thirty miles. Thought that as a stock country the region near the Little Colorado was very excellent. Distance form ferry in Colorado to Little Colorado River, about 125 miles. Said the Moquis were anxious for our people to settle there, and said that many of their people were desirous of settling with our people. Referred to the principle of celestial marriage and bore testimony to its divinity. Exhorted to faithfulness and obedience.</p>

<p class="p12">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p12">I received your telegram and shall be readdy to go when you come along, but I don't have any idea that you can go up over the divide by upper Kanab. I have had two years experience when the snow was melting the ground is such a nature that it will mire a horse right down. It will be about the worst, the time you will get there. I have tride it a horse back and with teams. You do not say how long you wanted me to set up for, for a long or short journey but can be reddy for either. My folks are as well as usual. The Spring is cold and backward. The Brethren are just commencing ploughing and putting in their grain. Our coopperative stock and sheep herds have done exceedingly well for so hard a winter. We have lost about 30 head of sheep out of five thousand and the rest is doing well. The prospect is we will have a plenty of prospectors here as soon as the snow gets out of the hills. Praying for your prosperity I remain your Brother in the gospel. L W Roundy</p>
