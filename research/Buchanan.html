I started researching the old Kentucky newspapers that began in the late 1700's. That is slow work, but may yield some information about the Back/Bach and Buchanan lines. Vital records from the time are sketchy.<ul><li>Continue research of old Kentucky Newspapers</li><li>Do some research into the brothers and sisters, aunt and uncles of AWO Buchanan. There is a lot of missing data.</li><li>Continue to study the possibility of getting Irish records that may fill in information about the family as they lived there.</li></ul></td></tr></table><hr><a href="../index.html">Back to Buchanan/Davis Family History web pages.</a></body></html>
