I intend to continue this. There are a couple of microfilms that cover the area of the family in Sor&oslash; and as I get time to go to the library, I will continue to work on it. The nature of the information is inexact and can get confusing. Sometimes I just have to make my best guess. I pray for guidance and so far I feel I have been led to where I have found records that make sense.<ul><li>Continue Svendsen research, including sibling lines.</li><li>Research some of the other end lines in original Danish records.</li></ul></td></tr></table><hr><a href="../index.html">Back to Buchanan/Davis Family History web pages.</a></body></html>
