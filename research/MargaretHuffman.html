<html><body><h3>Margaret Huffman or Hoffman - What is known about her? Whose wife is she, Harmon or John Back?</h3><cite>Joseph F. Buchanan, 29 June 2002, West Jordan, UT</cite><p>This document  is intended to clarify the true identity of Margaret Huffman and show that she was in fact the wife of John Back and not the wife of his brother Harmon Back, Jr., as recorded in numerous records of the LDS Ancestral File as well as many personal genealogy records of the Buchanan family.<p>Margaret Huffmann was born Nov. 27, 1748 in Orange Co., Virginia. Her parents were John Hoffmann (later Huffman) and Maria (Mary) Sabina Folg. This and most subsequent information is recorded in the book, "The Germanna Record" Number three, April 1963, official publication of the Memorial Foundation of the Germanna Colonies in Virginia, Incorporated. Much of the other information in this document came from that publication, but where original sources were found they have been noted. The record of her birth is mentioned on page 7 (listing Margaret as Anna Margaret). There was no specific record mentioned that specified the birth information, and the original records, so far, have not been found to corroborate this information. Other records do indicate that this birth information is likely to be true. There is a reference to another Germanna publication, where the author states: "His [John Huffman's] other daughters married men from the second Nassau-Siegen group in the Little Fork of the Rappahannock, which I treated in the 1960 Bulletin of the Memorial Foundation of the Germanna Colonies." - Vol. 3 p. 9. I have not been able to locate this publication.<p>According to records found, Margaret was married to John Back, son of Harman Back (or Bach) of Little Fork settlement of the Rappahannock. Her sister, Elizabeth, married John's brother, Henry Back.<p>Recorded events following 1748 are listed, in chronological order, along with source information:<p>1. 30 Dec 1762 - Will, probated 17 Aug 1772 - Culpeper Co.

The records so still mention that Margaret Back was willed the land by a John Huffman, deceased, though, and that seems to clarify the relationship she has to both the Huffman family and the Back family.<p>8. 2 Nov. 1803 - Deed - Madison Co.
