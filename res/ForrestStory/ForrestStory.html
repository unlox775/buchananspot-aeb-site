This memory has always been there to encourage me onward through life. Through it I know that I have a father who is strong, wise and caring. He only was there for me until a short time after I started my own adventure as a father, but I know that he still watches over me. Above all, he showed me through his life, example and humble teaching that I have a Heavenly Father who is also strong, wise and caring, and that as we try in our own meager way to live our lives, our divine father is watching over us, ready to pick us up when we fall and always ready to take our hands and walk with us through adversity as well as happy times, regardless of where our own tiny feet have taken us. This story is of Forrest's life and of the impressions he etched into my life.<p>Though I always called him Daddy or Dad, I will refer to him in this history by his name.<p><hr><cite> Note: In these files, a few names and dates have been obscured for privacy reasons</cite><p><b>Next: <a href=Early.html> Part 1: Beginnings in Venice until Mission to New England</a></b><br><a href=Mission.html>Part 2: Mission to New England</a><br><a href=Marriage.html>Part 3: Marriage and Family</a><br><a href=Health.html> Part 4:About  LIfe, Health, Humor, Love</a><br><p><hr><a href=ForrestTimeline.html> Appendix A - Life Timeline</a><br><a href=ForrestJournals.html> Appendix B - Histories and journals</a><br><a href=ForrestMission.html> Appendix C - Mission Journal</a><br><a href=ForrestRecipes.html> Appendix D - Recipes</a></body></html>
