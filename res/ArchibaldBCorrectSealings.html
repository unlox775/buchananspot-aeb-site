<html><body><h4>This is to verify the sealing dates of Archibald Waller Overton Buchanan to his 4 wives</h4><p>Archibald Waller Overton Buchanan<br/>	born 9 Feb. 1830 - Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky</p><p>Married:<br/>	1. Helen Amelia Whiting - 22 Aug. 1854<br/>		(note: son Archibald Walter born 21 Jan 1859)<br/>	2. Mary Ann Brown - 1 Jan. 1860<br/>	3. Anne Marie Larsen - 11 Oct. 1869<br/>	4. Caroline Sophia Sorensen - 27 Sep. <u>1875</u></p><p>The following is taken directly from the microfilm of the Endowment House records(verification done 7 Mar. 1991):</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>Family History Library film #183396<br/>	Endowment House book F, entry 14272, dated 11 Oct. 1869	<br/>Archibald Walter Buchanan - born Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky on 9 Feb. 1830<br/>	sealed to:<ul>	<li> Amelia Helen Whiting - born Nelson, Portage, Ohio on 21 Aug. 1836	<li> Mary Ann Brown - born Greenville, Floyd, Indiana on 2 Oct. 1841	<li> Anne Marie Larsen - born Slagelse, Zealand, Denmark on 20 Sep. 1851<br>	sealed by D. H. Wells, witnesses: J. F. Smith and W. W. Phelps</ul></p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br/>Family History Library film #183400	Endowment House book J, entry 5089, dated 27 Sep. 1875	Archibald Walter Buchannan - born Fayette, Kentucky on 9 Feb. 1830	sealed to:<ul>	<li> Caroline Sorensen - born Torby, Holbeck, Kentucky on 30 Apr. 1858<br>	sealed by W. Woodruff, witnesses: Wm. H. Folsom and Wm. A. Bills</ul></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Note: There are some obvious errors here including the birth palce of Caroline Sorensen (should be Denmark), and the spelling of Archibald's last name in the 1875 record.  Apparently, either Archibald was going by Archibald Walter at this time, or else the clerk in both cases wrote it the same way.  By the birth date and place it is definite that this is really Archibald Waller Overton Buchanan and NOT Archibald Walter, his son, born in 1859.</p><p>Important Note: In all of the family group sheets that I have seen, the marriage/sealing date of Archibald and Caroline Sorensen has been listed as 27 Sep. 1876, but as can be seen from the Endowment House records, it really took place in 1875.</p><p>7 March 1991<br/>Joseph F.
