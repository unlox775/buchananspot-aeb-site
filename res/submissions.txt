I looked at the information under my name on my dad's page and I have a few corrections and contributions to make.  My children are as follows Kayley Throop married to Nathan Throop, daughter, Claire Elizabeth Throop, 1-15-04.  Casey Kirkland (deceased), Karen Kirkland Bowcutt, married to James Donald Bowcutt, (baby due in March).Holly and Shalmai should really go under Belle's posterity page.  They never actually took the name of Kirkland.  So here is their information.  It should go under the James Molloy section of Aunt Belle's page.Shalmai Molloy Littleford, married to Jeffrey Littleford.  Children Jaiden Molloy 9-2-90, Cameron Molloy 7-7-94, Luke Littleford 8-26-01. Holly Molloy Cather, married to Dana Cather.  Children Makenzie Cather 6-10-91, Trevor Cather 6-28-94, Zachery Cather 5-2-01.Matthew Molloy, married to Tina (I don't know her maiden name).  Children Savannah, Noah.  (I don't know their birthdates)Rachael Molloy, son Kyle Molloy.  All of the birthdates might not be right on the children since I am going from memory, but I will direct them to this page to check the information and let you know if there are corrections that need to be made.Also under Bryan, he has another son, Dallin who will be 12 in May and his son Joshua is married to Tricia Wells.  Melissa's children are Carissa, 15, Jeffrey 13, Jordan, 11, and Kamilyn, 7.I'm sure there are more changes, but those are the most obvious ones.Thanks for all you do.  We appreciate your dedication and efforts.MK "{@}"AEB","Friday, August 18, 2006 10:05:14","Robert Newel Reynolds","303-973-9516","robertnreynolds@comcast.net","I have a pdf file with a couple of images that I want to send you.
