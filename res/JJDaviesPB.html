Thou art one of the noble spirits that hath been reserved for a long period of time to come forth in this dispensation to take an active part in the establishment of God's kingdom upon the earth.</p><p>Thou hast been true and faithful and thy sins are forgiven thee and thy labors are accepted of the Lord, therefore let thy heart be comforted for many are the blessings that are laid up in store for thee. Thy name is recorded in the Lamb's book of life and a good and Holy being hath charge concerning thee. Thy last days shall be thy best, crowned with peace and plenty and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon thee to an increased degree that thou mayest more fully comprehend His great purposes. Thy influence will increase among the people and great wisdom shall be given thee. Thou shalt be crowned a King and Priest unto God and reign in Celestial Glory over a Kingdom and dominion to which there shall be no end. All these blessings I seal upon thy head with the gift of eternal lives in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.<hr><a href="index.html">Back to Restricted area web page.</a><p><a href="../index.html">Back to Buchanan Family History web pages.</a></body></html>
