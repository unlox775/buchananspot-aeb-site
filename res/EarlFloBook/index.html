Archie Earl and his twin sister Carrie Myrl were born March 25, 1892, in Colonia Dublan Mexico. Their parents, Archibald Waller Overton Buchanan, and Caroline Sophia Sorenson Buchanan (page 4), had been counseled to go to Mexico with other church members who were exiles for the Gospel's sake. There they were offered protection for the privilege of making a living. Archibald worked in a flour mill - a grist mill that ground grain into flour.<p>"The family loved in a little log cabin with a dirt floor and a dirt roof. Nevertheless it was kept clean and tidy. Here in this humble home filled with love, the twins Archie Earl and Carrie Myrl were born, the last two of Archibald's wonderful family. The 'midwife' who officiated was Harry L. Payne, a son-in-law of Archibald's. His only qualifications were that he was neat and clean and full of faith.<p>Earl remembered having this picture taken (page 4). He had never seen a rocking horse before. Myrl didn't want her picture taken and the only way she would consent was that she would be given a candy stick. She is holding the candy stick between the horse's ears.<p>Earl had two older sisters, Delilah and Mary Ann. Three brothers died in infancy, Loren, Aaron and Ammon." <p><table border="0"><tr><td>L to R<br>Archie Earl Buchanan<br>Mary Ann Buchanan Black<br>Delilah Buchanan Poole<br>Carrie Myrl Buchanan Brugger</td><td>Mother: Caroline Sophia Sorenson Buchanan - Center<br>L. to R.

They moved back to Glenwood near Richfield, with his other families.<p>Earl and Myrl started school in the fall of 1898 in Glenwood, in the old adobe school house. In those days the children had two years of beginners classes, and then first grade.<p>At Christmas time Earl would usually get a harmonica, and a few nuts and candy. One time at a Christmas program a Christmas tree was decorated with lighted candles, which was the custom in those days. Santa Claus was there, wearing a red suit trimmed with white cotton. The cotton caught fire, and Santa Claus was burned quite badly.<p>In the summer of 1900, Earl and Myrl were baptized in the old mill stream by the grist mill in Glenwood.<p>About a year later, 1901-1902 they moved to Venice where others of the family were settling. Earl's father was Branch President before Venice was a ward. His father could speak the Indian language, and he did a lot of work with the Indians.<p>Archibald was getting old, and Caroline and her children had to struggle hard to make a living.<p><table border="0"><tr><td valign="top"><p>&nbsp;<p>Archie Earl Buchanan<p>As a Young Man</td><td valign="top"><img src="../../images/YoungEarl.jpg" width="180" height="270"></td></tr></table><p>&nbsp;<p>As he grew up, Earl worked on farms, herded cows, worked on the threshing machine, and was a willing and hard worked at anything he could find to do.<p> The year Earl and Myrl were ready to graduate from eighth grade, a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Venice School. School was closed in December for the rest of the school year. In order to graduate, which was an important event, every eighth grader had to take the county examinations in Richfield. Earl and Myrl were deeply disappointed and afraid they couldn't qualify. But with special tutoring by the principal, James L. Despain, they passed the tests, and were rated among the top students in the county. About Sept. 1, that year, Earl received a letter from Sevier County Supt. P. D. Jensen. The letter said, "By reason of your qualifications, you are awarded a four year scholarship to the University of Utah. Be there Sept. 19 to register." Earl was very excited, but wondered how he could go to school and leave his mother with the chores and so many things to do. After much discussion, it was decided he must take the opportunity offered to him. The family rallied to his support and he went to Salt Lake City to live with his sister Mary Ann, and her husband Joseph Black.<p><center><img src="../../images/MaryAnnJosephBlack.jpg" width="576" height="400"></center><p>He had a most wonderful experience that year. His college career came to a sudden end when he received word that his father was sick, mentally and physically, and his mother needed him desperately. So he put his dreams behind him and returned home.<p><table border="0"><tr><td>Mahonri Breinholt helped him build a house for his mother and father.

She worked throughout the area, and delivered over one hundred babies during her career. That was a lot of babies in that day and time. When she was called to deliver a baby, it was usually in the middle of the night, and always in the home. Babies were always born at home in those days. Earl was always there to help her get ready to go. He would go out and feed the horse, and hitch up the horse and the buggy, while his mother had a bath and got her things ready to go. Two things she always took along: her little black bag, and a small kerosene lamp. The little lamp seemed to give comfort and cheer to the mothers she took are of.<p>Caroline's life of service shines brightly like her little kerosene lamp.<p>Earl's father's health failed, and he died in 1915.<p>&nbsp;<p><p>&nbsp;<p><center>54<img src="../../images/CloFlo.jpg" width="750" height="516"><br> Clorene and Florene Davis</center><p>&nbsp;<p>Now we will go to Florene's life story.

Their grandparents John Johnson Davies and Maria lived with them part of the time.<br>The Davis family always liked to sing. When a crowd of them would get together, they would always enjoy singing many songs.<br>The twins always dressed alike. Their mother made their clothes. They always had nice night clothes. At Christmas they would hang their stockings by the fireplace.<p><center><img src="../../images/KanarraMountains.jpg" width="450" height="317"></center><p>While living in Kanarra, Henry would take his family to a ranch in the nearby mountains to spend the summer. There they milked cows, churned butter, made cheese, and sold these products to the families in town. Although they worked hard, the family enjoyed the days spent in the mountains.<br>On June 14, 1901, the family moved to Venice. They travelled in a covered wagon. They stayed at the home of John Ford for a while, and they bought a farm and home east of Venice. Three more children were added to the family: Stanley, Faye Belle, and Verda Mae. Some years later, they bought the Jakeman home back of the Venice Store.<center></center><table border="0"><tr><td valign="top"><img src="../../images/DavisHomeVenice.jpg" width="455" height="448"><br>45<p>Venice home of Henry William and Annie I.

Their names created quite a sensation. They were called the Chemical Twins. As time passed, their names were shortened to Flo and Clo. Here at school they developed their God given talents for cooking and sewing. Uncle Stan said, when they came home from school, the family were in for some fancy, delicious, and different cooking, whether they liked it or not.</td><td valign="top"><img src="../../images/FloCloPicture27.jpg" width="389" height="557"><br>27</td></tr></table><p><center><img src="../../images/ArchieEarl.jpg" width="400" height="620"><img src="../../images/FloreneDavis2.jpg" width="400" height="539"></center>In 1916 Earl fell in love with Flo Davis, a sweet, blue-eyed, dark haired girl.

They returned by train on Feb. 9 to Venice, where they had a most wonderful wedding reception.<br>Earl and Flo moved into the home with Earl's mother. Earl built another home for his mother across the canal from Myrl and George Brugger. His mother Caroline lived here a few short years when she suffered a stroke. She died May 23, 1928.<p><table border="0"><tr><td>On March 7, 1918, a beautiful baby boy was born to Earl and Flo.

Maxine climbed up in the pantry and got a bottle of Castoria off the shelf. Castoria was a good tasting children's laxative. She gave a spoonful to Deane, a spoonful to Forrest, and a spoonful to Belle. Then she drank the rest. Dad said it didn't take long to find out who got the most.<br>Forrest was several years older than this when he and some friends built a frame but down by the river. They heated their hut with a monkey stove, and sometimes they'd cook fudge on the stove. A monkey stove is a small, wood burning stove. One night the stove got too hot, the hut caught fire, and burned to the ground. Fortunately no one was hurt.<br>Deane was quite a mud pie maker. One day she took a dozen or so eggs from the chicken coop to make her mud pies extra tasty. No one would have known what happened to all of the eggs that day, except she lined up all the broken shells along to tongue of the hay wagon nearby.<p>Belle was a few years older than this when she liked to get up really early in the morning and make the fire in the kitchen stove so mother could cook breakfast. This was summertime, and some mornings Belle would walk down the street to Una Oldroyd's house. Una had some dolls and table and chairs and things that she called her playhouse. She had these things outside, and Belle just loved to wash Una's doll clothes and hang them on the clothesline. Now Una didn't take very kindly to this, so Belle decided to stay home and just wash her own doll clothes, early in the morning.<br>In the center of Venice was a river bridge across the Sevier River. It was fun to stand on this bridge and watch the river, or throw rocks in the river. One day when Gloria was a little girl, she was standing on the river bridge by the rail kicking her foot. Her shoe came off, splashed in the water and was lost.<br>Jerry was a cute little blonde curly haired boy. One day Grandma Davis gave him a dime, and he knew just what to do. We went out and planted it in the garden. He was going to grow a money tree. Then when the money tree didn't grow, he couldn't remember where he planted it.<br>When David was about five or six years old, the family lived in Deweyville. The Bamberger train ran right in front of the house. The Bamberger train was a small passenger train that could stop rather quickly. One day David went across the street to the neighbors, and they gave him a great big watermelon. He was dragging the melon home in a gunny sack when he got stuck on the train tracks. The train had to stop for him, and the conductor got out of the train and said something to him. David would never tell us what the conductor said.<table border="0"><tr><td>This was our Venice church house.
